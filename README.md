The description from that course:
The blockchain is a revolutionary technology that allows for the secure, distributed, decentralized storage of information. Over the past few years, the blockchain has taken the engineering landscape by storm. Many people in the industry predict that the blockchain will disrupt the ways we interact with technology on the same way the Internet did in the early 2000s.

The blockchain is the main technology behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other prominent cryptocurrencies that we read about in the news today. By leveraging the blockchain, cryptocurrencies create a system of “trustless”ness. This cuts the need for middle men like banks and traders in economic systems.

Do you want to become a blockchain engineer and pioneer in this young market? The demand for people who understand, and even more so, can build blockchains, are appearing more and more today. Undoubtedly, the role of a blockchain engineer will become even more prevalent tomorrow.

For engineers, coders, and software developers, the best way to truly understand the revolutionary technologies of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, is to build a blockchain and cryptocurrency yourself. Therefore, this course will take you through implementing a blockchain and cryptocurrency - discovering the underlying techniques and concepts.

The course is designed into sections that introduce the main concepts of the blockchain one-by-one. By the end of the course, you will have a respectable blockchain project in your repertoire.

Some of the main course highlights:
- Build a Blockchain in the object-oriented programming style.
- Generate hashes for blocks in the chain.
- Unit Test Components of the Blockchain.
- Create an API around the Blockchain.
- Create a real-time connected peer-to-peer server.
- Implement a proof-of-work algorithm.
- Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.
- Create a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.
- Include transactions in core blocks of the chain.

We’ll use NodeJS to implement this project. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with JavaScript. This course explains the purpose behind every line and keyword. So, while JS experience will help, it’s not an absolute requirement.

Ultimately, knowledge of the Blockchain will set you up for success in the future, as an engineer in a blockchain-dominated world. So what are you waiting for? Let’s get started building a blockchain!
